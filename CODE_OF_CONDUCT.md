- Welcome contributors regardless of background or experience level.
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully.
- Prioritize the technical quality and integrity of the project.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, personal attacks, or discriminatory language.
- Deliberately derailing technical discussions.
- Sharing private information about others without consent.
- Any conduct that would be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement

Maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, issues, and other contributions that violate this Code of Conduct. Repeated or severe violations may result in a temporary or permanent ban from the project.

## Reporting
